This package allows you to store page visits of different models into the database.

Once installed you can do stuff like this:

```php
// Return total visits of the article
$article->total_visits_count

// Return total visits of last 24 hours
$article->last_24h_visits_count

// Store new visit in the databae
$article->addVisit();
```

This package isn't built for tracking every page visit. It actually made more for providing a simple counter for Model items like a `Task`, `Article`, `Post` or `Course`. But of course you can use this package as want.

**Tip:** Create a Laravel Event called `Store{ModelName}View` to handle a visit for example a blog `Post`. Evertime you think it is worth to store the visit into the databse, you can fire this Event inside your Controller. In this Event you can write some code to check in the session if the current user has already viewed it. Maybe with some throttling checks.

## Installation

This package can be used in Laravel 5.4 or higher.

You can install the package via composer:
```winbatch
composer require cyrildewit/laravel-page-visits-counter
```

Now add the service provider in `config/app.php` file:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    Cyrildewit\PageVisitsCounter\PageVisitsCounterServiceProvider::class,
];
```

You can publish the migration with:

```winbatch
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Cyrildewit\PageVisitsCounter\PageVisitsCounterServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

After publishing the migration file you can create the `page visits` table by running the migrations:

```winbatch
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```winbatch
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Cyrildewit\PageVisitsCounter\PageVisitsCounterServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

## Usage

First add the `Cyrildewit\PageVisitsCounter\Traits\HasModelVisits` trait to your vieweble model(s).

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Cyrildewit\PageVisitsCounter\Traits\HasPageVisitsCounter;

class Article extends Model
{
    use PageVisitsCounter;

    // ...
}
```

### Retrieving Page Visits Count

```php
// Return total number of visits of the article.
$article->total_visits_count

$article->last_24h_visits_count // Only in past 24 hours
$article->last_7d_visits_count // Only in past 7 days
$article->last_14d_visits_count // Only in past 14 days

// Retrieve visits from past 2 weeks
$article->retrievePageVisitsFrom(Carbon::now()->subWeeks(2));

object retrievePageVisitsCountFrom( Carbon $from_date )

// Retrieve visits from past 2 weeks
$article->retrievePageVisitsCountBetween(Carbon::now()->subMonths(1), Carbon::now()->subWeeks(1));

object retrievePageVisitsCountBetween( Carbon $from_date, Carbon $end_date )
```

### Adding a new visit

```php
// Add one visit
$article->addVisit()
```

### Configuring the formatted number format

It is very easy to change the format of the converted numbers. Simply change the three parameters of the official function [`number_format()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.number-format.php).

In `config/page-visit-counter.php` you will find the following code:

```php
return [

    // ...

    'output-settings' => [

        /*
         * Set true for aut number output.
         */
        'formatted-output-enabled' => true,

        /*
         * The following optiosn will be used inside the
         * `number_format`function.
         * Example: 120000    ==> 120.000
         * Example: 500206000 ==> 502.006.000
         */
        'format-options' => [

            'decimals' => 0,
            'dec_point' => ',',
            'thousands_sep' => '.',

        ],

    ],

]
```

Special thanks to [Freek Van der Herten](https://github.com/freekmurze) who inspired me to create opensource Laravel packages. Before creating this package I didn't had any experience with creating a Laravel Package and how to use create composer.json files. Because he created a lot of opensource packages I could learn how to do it. Make sure you take a look at [his open source packages](https://spatie.be/nl/opensource/laravel) as well!
